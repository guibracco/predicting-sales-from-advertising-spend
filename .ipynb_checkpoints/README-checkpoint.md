Assignment: Predicting Sales from Advertising Spend.

Problem Statement:
HINA Inc. is a large FMCG company that is streamlining its marketing budget. This involves taking stock of all its marketing strategies. This, in turn, means re-assessing the effectiveness of its existing spend on various marketing channels. As a marketing data analyst, you need to figure out if spending money on TV advertising campaigns results in a direct increase in sales. In other words, you need to find out if the TV advertising spend and the sales figures share a linear relationship and how strong that relationship is.

Data: You are provided with historical advertising data – weekly sales and spend on each channel – for almost the 4 previous years.

Assuming an alpha value of 0.05 or 5%, your analysis should state clearly if there is significant evidence to show that the TV advertising campaigns have a relationship with the sales.

FURTHER WORK: Perform the same analysis/operations for the Radio and Newspaper campaigns and state resulting feedback.

SUBMISSION: A PYTHON SCRIPT detailing data ingestion, cleaning (if need - Explain why any method of cleaning or replacement was used), analysis between the Individual campaign spends and the Sales.
